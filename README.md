# Bike Share Project Arena
 Bike share provides free or affordable access to bicycles for short-distance trips in urban areas as an alternative to motorized vehicles. Therefore bike-share systems have become increasingly important for their environmentally friendly, convenient, and low-cost characteristics. In this project, we are studying the nation’s largest bike-share program, Citi Bike, and building a simulation model to analyze and improve the daily operation of the Citi bike share system.
 The dataset we are analyzing is the ‘Citibike_6_Stations_Week-Days.xlsx’ file, which is a modified version of the original Citi bike dataset. We are using the June 2017 part of the original dataset and weekend trips were removed. Moreover, we are only considering 4 stations out of 6 stations (out of 608 stations in the original dataset).
